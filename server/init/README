This directory contains a suggested initscript and skeleton
configuration file for automatic starting of the Frozen-Bubble
server.

Since the Frozen-Bubble server at least needs to know the name of
the server (as displayed in the Frozen-Bubble clients which will
have to choose between available servers), a configuration file
is best suited for this purpose.

The initscript by default loads the '/etc/fb-server.conf' file
(-c commandline option controls the name of the configuration
file, if you need to modify its location or name). You have to
install and modify the skeleton configuration file specifying the
name of your server. Name must be 12 characters long maximum and
only contain characters in [a-z0-9.-].

If needed, other configuration parameters can be set in the
configuration file. Each configuration parameter must be on its
own line, first character is the name of the option, followed if
needed by a space character and the string parameter of the
option. The list of options can be retrieved by launching the
Frozen-Bubble server with option '--help'.

Here's an example of configuration file copied from the skeleton
configuration file, but also specifying the server name, a
different server port and LAN mode:

--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<-----
# Name of the server as seen by FB players
n zarb
# Change default port
p 1789
# Also create an UDP server for easy LAN games.
l
--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<-----

Notice that the registration process of the server is done
automatically if the -q option is not set. The remote end as seen
by www.frozen-bubble.org is used as IP, and the TCP port used
(defaults to 1511 or specified with -p) as port. If you're using
host/port forwarding, you can use the options -H and -P to
register the proper host/port as seen from outside.
