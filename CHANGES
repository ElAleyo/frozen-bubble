Fri Feb  8 13:13:58 2002: gc <guillaume.cottenceau at free.fr>

	* fb.pl: 0.9.2
	
	* README: fix line referral for footnote #6, fix a small english
	  typo (thx to sbi)
	 
	* Makefile:
	   - substitute hard paths by PREFIX-provided path, at the end of
	     the build
	   - provide a default PREFIX of /usr/local
	   - replace "make" occurences by "$(MAKE)" so that
	     porting on OpenBSD is now possible
	     
	* c_stuff/Makefile*: don't keep the perl generated makefile, it
	  contains site specific stuff :-(, so use an helper Makefile to
	  be sure to rebuild perl Makefile when necessary
	     
	* fb.pl: Change wording for "new keys" dialog, p2/p1 was not very
	  explicit, now "right-pl"/"left-pl"

	* fb.pl: Internalize my fixed version of
	  SDL::Surface::display_format since sdlpl-1.12 is bugged
          (doesn't free memory) (and also sdlpl-1.08 was bugged like that
	  -> the package will work with vanilla Mandrake 8.0)

	* c_stuff/lib/fbmdkcommon.pm: `backtrace' was missing :-(

	* SDL_mixer_patched: clean up site-specific files from configure

	* fb.pl: misc syntax fixes thx to pixel (a.k.a half pixelization)

	* SDL_mixer_patched/effect_position.c: endian patches from
	  Guillaume Morin <guillaume at morinfr.org>

	* INSTALL: created

	* fb.pl;frozen-bubble: use LD_PRELOAD instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	  to override perl-SDL LD_RUN_PATH messing with my patched
	  SDL_mixer (thx Olivier Andrieu <oandrieu at nerim.net>)

	* fb.pl: at the beginning of initializing the game, make a short
	  test to see if we have the data, to produce a more human
	  readable error message if they are missing

	
Tue Feb  5 23:26:40 2002: gc <guillaume.cottenceau at free.fr>
	 
	* fb.pl: 0.9.1 (Initial release)
