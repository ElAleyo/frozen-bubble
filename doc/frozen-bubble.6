.TH FROZEN-BUBBLE 6 "October, 2006" "FB" "The Frozen-Bubble game"

.SH NAME
frozen-bubble \- arcade/reflex game

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B frozen-bubble
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBFrozen-Bubble\fR game is a free software implementation of
a popular arcade/reflex game. The game mainly consists of firing
randomly chosen bubbles across the board. If the shoot ends up
having a clump of at least 3 bubbles of the same color, they all
pop. If some bubbles were sticked only on the popping clump, they
fall. In 1-player mode, the goal is to pop all the bubbles on the
board as quickly as possible. In 2-players or network mode, you
have to get your opponent to "die" before you.

.SH CONTROL
The default controlling mechanism is through the keyboard, but
you can play with a joystick or a joypad if it is supported by
the system (use the commandline option \fB-ji\fR to make sure
frozen-bubble detected your joysticks). A key (or a joystick
direction or button) is needed for moving the aim to the left,
moving the aim to the right, center, and fire.

.SH 1-PLAYER GAME
In single player mode, as a beginner the best training is to
choose \fBPlay Default Levelset\fR, which lets you run through
100 levels of an increasing difficulty. Pop all the bubbles of
each level to advance to the next level.

If you want to train for multiplayer, choose \fBMultiplayer
Training\fR which reproduces the conditions of 2-player or
network mode; the only difference is that created malus bubbles
are counted in your score, and you must get the highest score you
can in 2 minutes.

.SH 2-PLAYERS GAME
In 2-players mode, you can play against a friend (or a foe,
actually) on the same computer. The board is populated with
random bubbles, and your goal is to make big clumps to send malus
bubbles to your opponent.

.SH NETWORK GAME
If your computer has networking, you can choose LAN GAME to play
games against others on your local network (up to 5 players).
Frozen-Bubble will look for a game server on the local network
with a UDP broadcast, connect to it if found, or start a new game
server if not found.

If your computer is connected to Internet, you can choose NET
GAME to play against others on Earth (or beyond?). Frozen-Bubble
will retrieve the server list from the master server and propose
you to choose between available servers. The flag in front of a
server indicates the preferred language for chatting with others
before the game is started. The ping is the roundtrip when
talking with the server, choose a low ping when possible.
