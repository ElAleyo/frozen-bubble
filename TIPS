During net/lan game choose, there is a chat system. Here are the
available keys and tips:

- page up and page down allow you to navigate in history as in
  IRC programs

- use /help to view the available commands; notice that some
  commands are specific (for example /kick is available once a
  game has been created, to game creator)
