                   [[ Frozen-Bubble ]]


                      Requirements


SDL_mixer >= 1.2.2
	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

SDL perl >= 1.19.0 (tested successfully with 1.20.0 and 2.1.2)
	http://sdl.perl.org/
        http://zarb.org/~gc/t/SDL_perl-1.20.0.tar.gz

SDL_Pango >= 0.1.2 with FB API patch
        http://sdlpango.sourceforge.net/
        http://zarb.org/~gc/t/SDL_Pango-0.1.2-API-adds.patch

The glib is needed for the server (and the server is needed for
easy automatic LAN games).

The bzip2 and bzcat binaries are used to compress game records if
present, but FB can live without them.


                Installation instructions


[*] First, build Frozen-Bubble and provide the prefix where the
game will be installed (most probably /usr or /usr/local).

make OPTIMIZE="my_arch_opt_flags" PREFIX="my_prefix"


[*] Second, install the files on the system.

   - if you're root, you will choose the same prefix location
     than for previous step

make install PREFIX="my_prefix"

   - if you're not root, you need to install to a temporary
     directory where you have write access

make install PREFIX="/home/my_home/tmp/my_buildroot"
