The glib is needed for the server (and the server is needed for
easy automatic LAN games).

Several true type fonts are needed. They are available in the
'data' subdirectory though distributors would prefer to make a
requirement on packages providing these fonts, to save diskspace.
If you want to use the internal fonts, pass the options
DEJAVUPATH=internal DEJAVUOBLIQUEPATH=internal
SAZANAMIGOTHICPATH=internal to the main Makefile. If you want to
use external fonts, make sure these are the standard and oblique
DejaVu sans fonts (DejaVuSans.ttf and DejaVuSans-Oblique.ttf,
from http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/), and the Sazanami Gothic
font (sazanami-gothic.ttf from
http://sourceforge.jp/projects/efont/) and then pass the full
path to them as options to the main Makefile (for example
SAZANAMIGOTHICPATH=/usr/share/fonts/ttf/japanese/sazanami-gothic.ttf
etc).


                Installation instructions


[*] First, build Frozen-Bubble and provide the prefix where the
game will be installed (most probably /usr or /usr/local).

make OPTIMIZE="my_arch_opt_flags" PREFIX="my_prefix" DEJAVUPATH=... DEJAVUOBLIQUEPATH=... SAZANAMIGOTHICPATH=...


[*] Second, install the files on the system.

   - if you're root (case when you build a Debian package, or
     when you build it locally on your own machine), you will
     choose the same prefix location than for previous step

make install PREFIX="my_prefix"


   - if you're not root (case when you build a RPM package), you
     need to install to a temporary directory where you have
     write access

make install PREFIX="/home/my_home/tmp/my_buildroot"

   Then an external program such as RPM will collect the
   installed files and write the package.
