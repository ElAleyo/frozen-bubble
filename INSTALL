fontconfig (reasonably recent, series 2.3 or upper should be fine)

The glib is needed for the server (and the server is needed for
easy automatic LAN games).


                Installation instructions


[*] First, build Frozen-Bubble and provide the prefix where the
game will be installed (most probably /usr or /usr/local).

make OPTIMIZE="my_arch_opt_flags" PREFIX="my_prefix"


[*] Second, install the files on the system.

   - if you're root, you will choose the same prefix location
     than for previous step

make install PREFIX="my_prefix"

   - if you're not root, you need to install to a temporary
     directory where you have write access

make install PREFIX="/home/my_home/tmp/my_buildroot"
